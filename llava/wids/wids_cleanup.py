"""
This module provides utilities for managing files in a directory.

It includes a function `keep_most_recent_files` that keeps the most recent 
files in a directory, deleting the rest based on the maximum size of the directory 
in bytes and the maximum number of files to keep.

The cleanup job can be run in the background using `create_cleanup_background_process`.
