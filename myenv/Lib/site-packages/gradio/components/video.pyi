class Video(Component):
    """
    Creates a video component that can be used to upload/record videos (as an input) or display videos (as an output).
    For the video to be playable in the browser it must have a compatible container and codec combination. Allowed
    combinations are .mp4 with h264 codec, .ogg with theora codec, and .webm with vp9 codec. If the component detects
    that the output video would not be playable in the browser it will attempt to convert it to a playable mp4 video.
    If the conversion fails, the original video is returned.
    Preprocessing: passes the uploaded video as a {str} filepath or URL whose extension can be modified by `format`.
    Postprocessing: expects a {str} or {pathlib.Path} filepath to a video which is displayed, or a {Tuple[str | pathlib.Path, str | pathlib.Path | None]} where the first element is a filepath to a video and the second element is an optional filepath to a subtitle file.
    Examples-format: a {str} filepath to a local file that contains the video, or a {Tuple[str, str]} where the first element is a filepath to a video file and the second element is a filepath to a subtitle file.

        Parameters:
            value: A path or URL for the default value that Video component is going to take. Can also be a tuple consisting of (video filepath, subtitle filepath). If a subtitle file is provided, it should be of type .srt or .vtt. Or can be callable, in which case the function will be called whenever the app loads to set the initial value of the component.
            format: Format of video format to be returned by component, such as 'avi' or 'mp4'. Use 'mp4' to ensure browser playability. If set to None, video will keep uploaded format.
            sources: A list of sources permitted for video. "upload" creates a box where user can drop an video file, "webcam" allows user to record a video from their webcam. If None, defaults to ["upload, "webcam"].
            height: The height of the displayed video, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units if a string is passed.
            width: The width of the displayed video, specified in pixels if a number is passed, or in CSS units if a string is passed.
            label: The label for this component. Appears above the component and is also used as the header if there are a table of examples for this component. If None and used in a `gr.Interface`, the label will be the name of the parameter this component is assigned to.
            every: If `value` is a callable, run the function 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Has no effect otherwise. Queue must be enabled. The event can be accessed (e.g. to cancel it) via this component's .load_event attribute.
            show_label: if True, will display label.
            container: If True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.
            scale: relative width compared to adjacent Components in a Row. For example, if Component A has scale=2, and Component B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
            interactive: if True, will allow users to upload a video; if False, can only be used to display videos. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.
            visible: If False, component will be hidden.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            render: If False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
            mirror_webcam: If True webcam will be mirrored. Default is True.
            include_audio: Whether the component should record/retain the audio track for a video. By default, audio is excluded for webcam videos and included for uploaded videos.
            autoplay: Whether to automatically play the video when the component is used as an output. Note: browsers will not autoplay video files if the user has not interacted with the page yet.
            show_share_button: If True, will show a share icon in the corner of the component that allows user to share outputs to Hugging Face Spaces Discussions. If False, icon does not appear. If set to None (default behavior), then the icon appears if this Gradio app is launched on Spaces, but not otherwise.
            min_length: The minimum length of video (in seconds) that the user can pass into the prediction function. If None, there is no minimum length.
            max_length: The maximum length of video (in seconds) that the user can pass into the prediction function. If None, there is no maximum length.

        Parameters:
            fn: the function to call when this event is triggered. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            inputs: List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.
            outputs: List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.
            api_name: Defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the api docs. If set to None, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs as an unnamed endpoint, although this behavior will be changed in Gradio 4.0. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs with the given name.
            scroll_to_output: If True, will scroll to output component on completion
            show_progress: If True, will show progress animation while pending
            queue: If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.
            batch: If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            max_batch_size: Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)
            preprocess: If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).
            postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.
            every: Run this event 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Interpreted in seconds. Queue must be enabled.
            trigger_mode: If "once" (default for all events except `.change()`) would not allow any submissions while an event is pending. If set to "multiple", unlimited submissions are allowed while pending, and "always_last" (default for `.change()` event) would allow a second submission after the pending event is complete.
            js: Optional frontend js method to run before running 'fn'. Input arguments for js method are values of 'inputs' and 'outputs', return should be a list of values for output components.
            concurrency_limit: If set, this is the maximum number of this event that can be running simultaneously. Can be set to None to mean no concurrency_limit (any number of this event can be running simultaneously). Set to "default" to use the default concurrency limit (defined by the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter in `Blocks.queue()`, which itself is 1 by default).
            concurrency_id: If set, this is the id of the concurrency group. Events with the same concurrency_id will be limited by the lowest set concurrency_limit.
            show_api: whether to show this event in the "view API" page of the Gradio app, or in the ".view_api()" method of the Gradio clients. Unlike setting api_name to False, setting show_api to False will still allow downstream apps to use this event. If fn is None, show_api will automatically be set to False.

        Parameters:
            fn: the function to call when this event is triggered. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            inputs: List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.
            outputs: List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.
            api_name: Defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the api docs. If set to None, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs as an unnamed endpoint, although this behavior will be changed in Gradio 4.0. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs with the given name.
            scroll_to_output: If True, will scroll to output component on completion
            show_progress: If True, will show progress animation while pending
            queue: If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.
            batch: If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            max_batch_size: Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)
            preprocess: If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).
            postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.

        """
        Parameters:
            fn: the function to call when this event is triggered. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            inputs: List of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.
            outputs: List of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.
            api_name: Defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the api docs. If set to None, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs as an unnamed endpoint, although this behavior will be changed in Gradio 4.0. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs with the given name.
            scroll_to_output: If True, will scroll to output component on completion
            show_progress: If True, will show progress animation while pending
            queue: If True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.
            batch: If True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            max_batch_size: Maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)
            preprocess: If False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).
            postprocess: If False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: A list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.
            every: Run this event 'every' number of seconds while the client connection is open. Interpreted in seconds. Queue must be enabled.
            trigger_mode: If "once" (default for all events except `.change()`) would not allow any submissions while an event is pending. If set to "multiple", unlimited submissions are allowed while pending, and "always_last" (default for `.change()` event) would allow a second submission after the pending event is complete.
            js: Optional frontend js method to run before running 'fn'. Input arguments for js method are values of 'inputs' and 'outputs', return should be a list of values for output components.
            concurrency_limit: If set, this is the maximum number of this event that can be running simultaneously. Can be set to None to mean no concurrency_limit (any number of this event can be running simultaneously). Set to "default" to use the default concurrency limit (defined by the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter in `Blocks.queue()`, which itself is 1 by default).
            concurrency_id: If set, this is the id of the concurrency group. Events with the same concurrency_id will be limited by the lowest set concurrency_limit.
